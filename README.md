# 499_Final_Project
Code from final project

This was the final project for my CPS 499 IoT and Embedded Devices class and was also
presented at UD 2023 Stander Symposium

For my project, I developed a workflow across Node-RED and Losant to track a 
personâ€™s location, speed, course, and acceleration to provide feedback on their 
movement. This was accomplished using a Raspberry Pi to send GPS and acceleration 
data from Node-RED to Losant for visualization and analysis.

I got this idea because this last December, I had foot surgery and could not drive. When
my mom drove me, I commented on her driving, and she said she was driving better 
than I would. Because I was starting to use my foot again, I wanted to prove that I was a 
better driver so I could prove it with actual data. Additionally, the project could provide 
general feedback on a person driving and send alerts based on events during logging.

I recorded a short demo showing each part of the final project and how they worked
together. Please reach out if you want to view the implementation of the project 
or have any questions.
